            <h1>Should the Internet be Regulated?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="info my-3 romo">
            <p  class="my-3"><b>Hardly a day goes by without a cybercrime story.</b></p><br>
            <p>A two-day conference for Internet experts at the University of Toronto that started Sunday on what is called stewardship
            of the Internet will ask what can be done. Specifically, it asks Who has responsibility for cyberspace, should it be
            controlled , and if so, by whom?</p><br>
            <p>“Pressure is building towards a constitutional moment,” says the Web page of the conference.” Major governments have
            begun to debate what should be the rules of the road for cyberspace, but agreement appears far off.”</p><br>
            <p>The conference is the second annual forum on Internet security hosted by the Munk School of Global Affairs. This year’s
            international speakers include the head of the FBI’s cyber division, a member of Public Safety Canada’s cyber security
            directorate, academics, privacy specialists as well as officials from Microsoft Corp. and Google.</p><br>
            <p>“Cyber security issues are extremely important to government,” he said in a pre-conference interview. “Both in the U.S.
            and Canada we’re seeing a lot of discussion about how to improve public-private partnerships on cybersecurity.”</p><br>
            <p>For his part, it will provide an opportunity to discuss AT&T’s that governments around the world should support work
            done by carriers and security companies while still having the flexibility to deal with rapidly changing threats.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>“Our chief security officer made the interesting point last week that that if you try and establish regulations that
            forces everyone to the point using the same type of security and tools of you’d actually be playing defence in a very
            predictable way and you’ll make it easier for those who to break in and cause harm. So our message has been we need to
            work together with government, but have the flexibility to respond to new threats.”</p>
            <br>
            <p>“What we’re saying is we need to get the technical people working together, we need government to be thinking about the
            right policies, but we can do that without creating a new regulatory structure to regulate the Internet by taking
            advantage of the strength of the Internet: it’s very flexible and can change rapidly. You have a lot of experts already
            working on theses issues.”</p>
