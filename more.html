            <p>The Internet (or internet)[a] is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the
                Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP)[b] to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of
                networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to
                global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The
                Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext
                documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.

            <p>The origins of the Internet date back to the development of packet switching and research commissioned by
                the United
                States Department of Defense in the 1960s to enable time-sharing of computers.[2] The primary precursor
                network, the
                ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks
                in the 1970s. The
                funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private
                funding for other
                commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies,
                and the merger
                of many networks.[3] The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the
                beginning of the
                transition to the modern Internet,[4] and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of
                institutional,
                personal, and mobile computers were connected to the network. Although the Internet was widely used by
                academia in the
                1980s, commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of
                modern life.</p><br>

                <p>In the 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense funded research
                into time-sharing of computers.[15][16][17] Research into packet switching, one of the fundamental Internet
                technologies, started in the work of Paul Baran in the early 1960s and, independently, Donald Davies in 1965.[2][18]
                After the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in 1967, packet switching from the proposed NPL network was
                incorporated into the design for the ARPANET and other resource sharing networks such as the Merit Network and CYCLADES,
                which were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s.</p><br>
                <p>Most traditional communication media, including telephone, radio, television, paper mail and newspapers are reshaped,
                redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as email, Internet telephone, Internet
                television, online music, digital newspapers, and video streaming websites. Newspaper, book, and other print publishing
                are adapting to website technology, or are reshaped into blogging, web feeds and online news aggregators. The Internet
                has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interactions through instant messaging, Internet forums, and social
                networking services. Online shopping has grown exponentially for major retailers, small businesses, and entrepreneurs,
                as it enables firms to extend their "brick and mortar" presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services
                entirely online. Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire
                industries.</p><br>
